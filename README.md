This game simply tests your risk appetite.
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice. The player may decide to hold the score and change turn or add up with another roll.

If the player rolls a 1, their current score gets zeroed and the other player takes turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold" the current score, their turn total is added to their score and the other player takes turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
